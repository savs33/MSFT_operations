In terms of business, an Invoice is a request submitted to Microsoft Operations for processing an purchase order or refund or expense. A typical Order-to-Cash process for businesses involves accounts receivable collection after an invoice is issued to the customer. A usual payment term of 30, 45 or 60 days is often provided for the customer to make full payment of the invoiced amount.
